# Personal-Website
This is my personal website! With this I want to accomplish the following:
	 -Demonstrate my capability of HTML, CSS and JS skills
	 -List down my courses taken
	 -List down my past CS jobs and experiences, such as hackathons
	 -Have easy access to my resume
	 -Have easy access to contact me through email
	 -Have an easy access button to my github account
	 -Better my skills with web development
	 -Show my skills to make a website ADA compliant and mobile friendly
As of now it is a work in progress as I will be working on it little by little throughout the semester!
